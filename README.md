BitcoinAutoNode
===============

A script to run (ideally just after starting up a new server/vps) to automatically setup bitcoind and have it start on boot.

One Liner
---------

    wget -O btcNode.sh https://raw.github.com/BlueBlock/BitcoinAutoNode/master/bitcoinAutoNode.sh ; sudo bash btcNode.sh
    
You should really check out the code before running that though.
